# Flagger

Flagger is a trivia game where you can guess the names of regions based on their flag.

Features:
- Highscore: For each difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), you can set a new highscore.
- Random flags and possible answers: Each time you play, the questions and possible answers are randomized based on the difficulty.
- Flag choices: There are 195 countries, but about 250 official flags in the world, so you have a lot of guessing to do.

Future features:
- Timer for each game mode: Depending on the difficulty, the time you can take to guess a flag will be limited. And at the end of the game, you can see the highscore and the time it took you to do it.
- Capital guesser: You will be able to guess the capitals of regions and set a highscore.
- World map guesser: Guess the region based on an image from the world map.
- Mixing and matching: Being able to choose if you want the question to be a flag, region name, or capital, and the answers to be those same things, makes for quite a few combinations of game modes and an interesting challenge. For each you will be able to have your own highscore.
- Flag finder: You are displayed 50 randomized flags in a grid, and a region name displayed at the top, you have to find all 50 flags as fast as you can.
- Difficulty refinement: Currently the regions are separated in 3 difficulties based on their population (the more people, the more you've heard about it?), but that doesn't really define a flag difficulty.
